# Hotel Booking Form

## Description

Creating a hotel booking form, using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and a little bit of JS. The form will have frontend validation using HTML and PHP. The form will include a dropdown with at least 3 different hotel options. The daily rate of the hotel will be displayed on selection and the total amount will be calculated based on the the users selections. The users selections will then be displayed and the user will have the option to confirm or cancel the booking. If the user makes the same booking twice a message will be displayed to the user to notify them of the double booking usig php validation.

## Purpose

Made this website to challenge my knowledge of using php with mysql. To create this website I used OOP(object-oriented programming) to prove my skills of using advanced php with mysql commands to create tables and add and display data from those tables. I also created a login and registration page that will allow the user to firstly register with a unique username and then login using the created username and password.

## Learning
Creating this website I learned:

- How to use advanced php or object-oriented programming to make my code DRY.
- How to use the mysqli methods embedded within php.
- How to create a registration and login page and validate table data.
- How to check fo duplicates within a table.


## Setting up my workspace

- Created Repository
- Opened terminal and launched the command 'git clone "repo link"'
- Created base folder structure (classes, config, and img)
- Pushed Changes

## Getting Started

1. In the repository copy the link at the Clone or download button.

2. Open git bash and type "git clone" then paste the copied link and press enter.

3. Cd into the folder then copy the path.

4. Create a virtual host using **<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/">Wamp</a>**, **<a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer">Lamp</a>** or **<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">Xamp</a>** with the name of your choosing and paste the path to create your virtual host.

5. Refresh wamp and then open the virtual host and then you can do the quiz and see how much you know.
